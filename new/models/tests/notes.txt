Tests:
test0 - testing increasing the max_people from original code - worked no issues
test1 - first test of code in this repository - f1 and ds work, but scores lower
test2 - reducing batch size, reducing val size compared to test1
test3 - reverted batch size, increased learning rate
test4 - reverted val size back to test 1

overall - batch size and val size good, unsure about learning rate

Notes:
Test 3 showed unusually high val f1 (approaching 1 - unsure how this is possible)
 - One hypothesis is small sample size makes this easier to occur (hence test 4)
 - Test 4 did not reach the same level of val F1, possibly validating this theory
 - Will talk to Dr. Vazquez about this more next Monday
